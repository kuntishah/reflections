What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git folder is made and it tracks history for file

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

working directory is not on it. repository is part of git itself and contains history of all the files.
staging area lets us make logical commits. I can add files to staging area and commit. Then add more files and commit logically.
